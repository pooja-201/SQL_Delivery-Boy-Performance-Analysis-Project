# SQL_Delivery-Boy-Performance-Analysis-Project
Analyzed 28K+ delivery records in MS SQL Server to assess efficiency. Cleaned data by handling nulls, removing duplicates, and standardizing values. Built consolidated tables using SQL JOINs, developed KPIs (avg age, ratings, delivery time, personnel performance), and derived insights on weather, traffic &amp; order type impact.
